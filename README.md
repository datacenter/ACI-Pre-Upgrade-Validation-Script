# Quick Start

1. copy `aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py` ([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacenter/ACI-Pre-Upgrade-Validation-Script/master/aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py?token=AJD5RRLZ5LVFDIW6Z6ZDIMTBBW5X6)) on your APIC (`/data/techsupport`)
2. `cd /data/techsupport`
3. `python aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py` 
4. follow recommendations for all checks that have been flagged as `FAIL` or `MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED`


# Introduction

The Goal of this script is to provide you with an automated list of proactive checks before performing an ACI fabric upgrade.  Each check is documented in the "Cisco ACI Upgrade guide - Pre-upgrade CheckLists" with a detailed explanation of the importance to resolve each issue before upgrading.

[ACI Upgrade Documentation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/all/apic-installation-upgrade-downgrade/Cisco-APIC-Installation-Upgrade-Downgrade-Guide.html)

Failure to address an affected issue before an upgrade is known to cause challenges during or post upgrade.

For every check that has been flagged as `FAIL`, a general recommended action has been provided to guide next steps.  There is also a summary with the number of checks that matched a given status.


# Preparation

Download the script from here: [aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacenter/ACI-Pre-Upgrade-Validation-Script/master/aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py?token=AJD5RRLZ5LVFDIW6Z6ZDIMTBBW5X6)

## ssh copy/paste and vi

1. SSH to an APIC in a fabric that is to be upgraded
2. `cd /data/techsupport`
3. `vi aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py`
4. press `i` for insert mode
5. paste the contents of aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py
6. `:wq` to save and quit vi
7. `chmod 755 aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py`

## local file transfer client

1. Download aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py locally
2. Transfer aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py onto an APIC using your sftp client of choice
   - `/data/techsupport` is an ideal location to place the script
3. SSH to the APIC which received the aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py script
4. `cd /data/techsupport`
5. `chmod 755 aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py`

# Usage

When run, the script will prompt for user credentials.

The script will then present a list of firmware from the APIC firmware repository and ask which one is the target 
version for the next 
planned upgrade. Ensure you have the desired ACI Firmware uploaded to the APIC Firmware Repository before 
running this script.

Notes:
1. If the APIC FIrmware Repository is empty, the script will proceed but will mark checks that required the target version as 
`MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED`

2. `admin` level privileges are recommended. User permissions are important as most of these checks rely on API query responses. 
Non-admin remote user credentials can result in RBAC causing queries to return empty responses.
This can result in inconsistent script results.

3. This script only performs read operations and will not modify any config or filesystem properties.

# Details

## Results

Each check has a unique result which will help determine how to proceed.  The results are explained as follows:

- **PASS** - The check has completed, and the ACI Fabric is not affected by the issue.
- **FAIL - OUTAGE WARNING** - The check has completed, and the ACI Fabric is currently affected by an issue which may cause an outage.
- **FAIL - UPGRADE FAILURE** - The check has completed, and the ACI Fabric is currently affected by an issue which may cause the upgrade to fail.
- **MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED** - The check has completed, and the specific check needs to be investigated manually using the steps outlines in the "ACI Upgrade Guide".
- **N/A** - The check completed successfully, and the ACI fabric is not susceptible because the needed configuration is not deployed.
- **ERROR** - The check did not complete successfully, and needs further investigation.

## General Checks

aci-preupgrade-validation-script.py currently performs the following checks:

Key:
- **CREDS** = credentials; uname/pw supplied on script run
- **CVER** = current version; Version on APIC during run
- **TVER** = Target Version; selected on run if found

## Log Files

A single log bundle will be generated with each run of the script

```
Result Bundle: /data/techsupport/preupgrade_validator_2021-07-27T17-13-12+0000.tgz
```
This bundle contains 3 inner files; debug.log, .json and .txt.
```
admin@APIC-1:techsupport> tar -xvf preupgrade_validator_2021-07-27T17-13-12+0000.tgz

preupgrade_validator_logs/preupgrade_validator_2021-07-27T17-13-12+0000.txt
```

the `preupgrade_validator_*.txt` file contains a dump of the resulting output which can be referenced for check results post-run.

If there are any issues with the script or run results which require TAC assistance, open a proactive TAC case for the 
upgrade and upload the result bundle for analysis.
