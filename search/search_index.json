However, if the link to the Cisco APIC flaps for any reason, primarily during an upgrade when the Cisco APIC reboots, the policy can then be deployed to that leaf switch interface. This results in the Cisco APIC being blocked from re-joining the fabric after it has reloaded.</p> <p>It is critical that you resolve these issues before the upgrade to prevent any issues. You can run the moquery below on the CLI of any Cisco APIC to check if these faults exist on the system.

This information is required from both leaf switches and hypervisors to dynamically detect the leaf interface connecting to the hypervisor, even when there is an intermediate switch in between such as Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect.

Starting from Cisco APIC release 3.0(1), VLANs will not be removed from the leaf interfaces even if the Cisco APIC loses the connectivity to the VMM controller to prevent transient management plane issues from impacting the data plane traffic.

However, VLAN 10 on each node will map to a different VLAN VNID, which may or may not be your intent.</p> <p>Without the Flood-in-Encap feature, VLAN VNIDs act as flooding domains for spanning tree BPDUs. Even if VLAN 10 on node 101 and 102 map to different VLAN VNIDs, regular traffic is forwarded without issues via bridge domain VNID or VRF VNID.</p> <p>This VLAN pool design is ideal for keeping the spanning tree domains small, such as in a multi-pod fabric with one STP domain per pod where each pod is physically separate with no L2 connecitivity between them except for the IPN. It helps contain spanning tree issues within a single pod. For instance, if Pod 1 continuously receives STP TCNs due to a malfuncationing device in the external network in Pod 1, the impact of flushing endpoints and causing connectivity issues due to TCNs is contained within that pod, keeping other pods unaffected.</p> <p>However, this design is not suitable if you prefer a simpler configuration, if the nodes belong to the same vPC switch pair, or if the VLAN uses the Flood-in-Encap feature.</p> <p>It is critical to ensure that there are no overlapping VLAN pools in your fabric unless it is on purpose with the appropriate understanding of VLAN ID and VXLAN ID mapping behind the scene.

This behavior has been changed based on CSCvm28482 and ACI no longer establishes a BGP session through a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile at a node profile when a loopback is not configured in the node profile. Instead, a fault F3488 is raised in these situations. This fault cannot be used as a pre-upgrade check because it is raised only after an upgrade.</p> <p>Due to this change, when upgrading from an older version to release 4.1(2) or later, a BGP session is no longer established if the session was generated via a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile under a node profile and a loopback is not configured in the node profile.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>When multiple interfaces in the same node profile need to establish a BGP peer with the same peer IP, you might attempt to configure a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile at a node profile without a loopback so that the same BGP Peer configuration is applied, as a fallback due to the missing loopback, to each interface in the same node profile. This is because a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile with the same peer IP address could not be configured at multiple interface profiles within the same node profile. This limitation was loosened based on CSCvw88636 on 4.2(7f). Until then, for this specific requirement, you need to configure a node interface per interface profile and configure the BGP Peer Connectivity Profile at each interface profile in a different node profile.</p>"},{"location":"validations/#l3out-route-map-importexport-direction","title":"L3Out Route Map import/export direction","text":"<p>Prior to upgrading to release 4.1(1) or later, you must ensure that the route map (route profile) configuration is correct.</p> <p>Due to the defect CSCvm75395, the following configuration might have worked prior to release 4.1(1) despite the wrong configuration (a mismatch in the direction):</p> <ul> <li>A route map with <code>export</code> direction attached to an L3Out subnet with Import Route Control Subnet</li> <li>A route map with <code>import</code> direction attached to an L3Out subnet with Export Route Control Subnet</li> </ul> <p>Where the L3Out subnet means the subnet configured under an External EPG in an L3Out.</p> <p>However, these wrong configurations will no longer work, which is the expected behavior, after you upgrade the fabric to release 4.1(1) or later.</p> <p>Although this method is not the most common or recommended one among many ways to control the routes being advertised or learned by ACI L3Outs, the correct configuration with this method should be as follows:</p> <ul> <li>A route map with <code>export</code> direction attached to an L3Out subnet with Export Route Control Subnet</li> <li>A route map with <code>import</code> direction attached to an L3Out subnet with Import Route Control Subnet</li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>Or alternatively, you can follow the recommended configurations below to control the route exchange in L3Outs instead:</p> <ul> <li><code>default-export</code> route map with IP prefix-lists</li> <li><code>default-import</code> route map with IP prefix-lists</li> </ul> <p>With this configuration, you don\u2019t need Export Route Control Subnet or Import Route Control Subnet in the external EPGs, and you can have external EPGs that are dedicated for contracts or route leaking while you have the full control of routing protocol through route maps just like a normal router.</p> <p>Also note that any import direction route maps only take effect when Route Control Enforcement is enabled for import under <code>Tenant &gt; Networking &gt; L3Out &gt; Main profile</code>.

If, after upgrading to 6.0(4)+, you exhibit broken bridging traffic in any identified BD, you MUST change this parameter to have your BD perform in the same manner as before the upgrade.</p> <p>If you are targeting 6.0(2) or 6.0(3) and suspect you will be affected by this due to having bridged traffic like the examples shown below, it is strongly recommended to INSTEAD target 6.0(4)+ to have the knob required to revert the BD behavior.</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"fvBD\": {\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"serviceBdRoutingDisable\": \"yes\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Example 1: clustering/HA heartbeat between service devices</p> <p>If the following two conditions are met, the probes will stop working after upgrading to 6.0(2) or later.</p> <ul> <li>There are heartbeat probes that are bridged between your service graph devices through the same bridige domain as the data traffic (i.e. the BD pointed by the service graph)</li> <li>The destination IP addresses of the probes are unicast and don't belong to the subnet(s) of the said BD</li> </ul> <p>Although this should not be common as it is typically a best practice to use a different path for those probes than the data traffic, if your design meets these condtions you can change the design to move the probe traffic to another bridge domain prior to the upgrade. Or you can change the setting of the service bridge domain to disable the forceful routing after your upgrade as shown above.</p> <p>This example is also explained in the \"Optional Configurations &gt; Service BD configuration option\" in ACI PBR Service Graph Whitepaper.</p> <p>Example 2: ACI CNI with SNAT</p> <p>ACI CNI with SNAT utilizes a virtual IP shared across multiple kubernetes nodes. ACI switches forward the traffic towards the virtual IP (i.e. one of the kubernetes nodes) via Service Graph PBR. However, there is a chance where the traffic sent to the kubernetes node that doesn't have the destination pod. This happens because the virtual IP is shared not just between multiple nodes but also between pods and it's mapped to each pod based on the L4 port. When the kubernetes node receives a packet to its virtual IP but its L4 port is not of its pod, the node will bounce the traffic to the other node by rewriting the MAC addresses in the ethernet header while the IP headers remain the same, which means it's a bridging traffic.</p> <p>This will stop working after upgrading to 6.0(2) or later because the service bridge domain ignores the MAC addresses and forcefully use the IP address, which is the same virtual IP again, to forward the packet. As a result, the packet will not be able to reach the correct kubenetes node.</p> <p>In this case, you need to prepare to change the setting of the service bridge domain to disable the forceful routing after your upgrade as shown above.</p> <p>See SNAT Traffic for Kubernetes with Cisco ACI CNI for details about ACI CNI with SNAT.</p>"},{"location":"validations/#ave-end-of-life","title":"AVE End-of-life","text":"<p>As outlined in the End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure Virtual Edge and Virtual Pod, the Cisco ACI Virtual Edge (AVE) Domain is end-of-life and end-of-support for ACI releases 6.0 and above.</p> <p>If planning an upgrade to 6.0+, review the Cisco ACI Virtual Edge Migration Guide and complete a domain migration prior to performing the upgrade.</p>"},{"location":"validations/#shared-service-with-vzany-consumer","title":"Shared Service with vzAny Consumer","text":"<p>A shared service (VRF Route Leaking) contract with vzAny as a consumer may use more policy TCAM space after an upgrade depending on the release version and provider type due to a behavior change called \"Rule Expansion\":</p> <ul> <li>In the case of EPG/External EPG providers, 5.3(2d) and later or 6.0(3) and later releases may use more policy TCAM space than releases older than 5.3(2d) or 6.0(3).</li> <li>In the case of ESG providers, 6.1(2) and later releases may use more policy TCAM space than releases older than 6.1(2).</li> </ul> <p>When Rule Expansion takes place after an upgrade, the increase in the TCAM space may result in TCAM overflow which can lead to traffic disruption because contracts that used to work may stop working.</p> <p>See Inter-VRF contract with vzAny as the consumer in Cisco ACI Contract Guide for details about Rule Expansion and calculate the potential TCAM space usage when the Rule Expansion takes place.
